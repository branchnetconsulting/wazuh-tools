# siem-agent-deploy.ps1
#
# This script is for checking and/or installing the Wazuh agent on Linux systems.  It can directly install or uninstall it, conditionally 
# install it, or simply check to see if installation/reinstallation is needed.  The Wazuh agent for Linux presently includes Wazuh agent 
# integrated for centralized configuration and reporting via the Wazuh manager.  It also defaults to signalling to the Wazuh manager to push 
# the Osquery management WPK to this agent, which can be optionally excluded.
#
# Depending on the use case, this script can be called singly on a one time or periodic basis to conditionally install/reinstall the agent.  
# Alternatively, a higher level configuration management system like Puppet could first call this script just to check if 
# installation/reinstallation is called for, and based on the exit code it receives, conditionally call this script a second time to  
# explicitly install/reinstall the agent.
#
# Deployment will install Wazuh agent on Ubuntu, CentOS, and Amazon Linux systems. 
#
# After preserving the working Wazuh agent registration key if present, if the -Install flag is used, the Wazuh agent is completely purged and 
# then reinstalled.  The Wazuh agent self-registration process is included, but will be skipped if an existing working registration can be recycled.
# If the -Install flag is not set and 1) the agent is connected to a manager and 2) the target groups appear at the beginning of the list of 
# current groups, the checkAgent function will find no deployment/re-deployment is needed and will bail with exit code 0. This will keep the same 
# agent id and agent name associated with the agent prior to the script being run. Groups that were manually added via the Wazuh interface will not 
# be used for comparison purposes, but will still be applied if the agent registration is recycled.  If the script-defined target group membership 
# list, including groups added by the -ExtraGroups parameter, are not listed in order at the beginning of the list of discovered current groups for
# the agent, but the agent is connected to a manager, the script will re-register without an uninstall and reinstall of Wazuh. 
#
# If the call to this script is deemed broken, or either the Wazuh Manager connect port or registration port are unresponsive to a probe, an 
# exit code of 2 will be returned.
#
# By default, the script will install a minimum default version of Wazuh as hard-coded in the script.  However, there are two optional ways to 
# override this hard-coded parameter; 1) add a txt record to a domain you control that includes the version number of the Wazuh agent you wish 
# to install or 2) specify a minimum version in the command call.  After the install, the intention is for the automated agent upgrade cron 
# call to upgrade all connected agents to the version of the Wazuh Manager it is connected to. 
#
# The default exit code is 0.
# Exit code of 1 from the checkAgent function indicates a redeploy/re-registeration is needed. This exit code is only used if the -CheckOnly flag is set
# on the command line.
# Exit code of 2 indicates that an error occurred or there was a problem with the command line parameters.
# 
# Is the agent presently really connected to the Wazuh manager?
# Is the agent currently a member of all intended Wazuh agent groups?
#
# Required Parameters:
#
# -Mgr					        The IP or FQDN of the Wazuh manager for ongoing agent connections.
# -RegPass     			    Password for registration with Wazuh manager (put in quotes).
#
# Optional Parameters:
#
# -RegMgr  				      The IP or FQDN of the Wazuh manager for agent registration connection (defaults to $Mgr if not specified)
# -AgentName   			    Name under which to register this agent in place of locally detected Windows host name.
# -ExtraGroups  		    Additional groups beyond the default groups that are applied by the script, which include:  
#						            linux, linux-local, osquery, osquery-local. 
# -VerDiscAddr			    The Version Discovery Address where a .txt record has been added with the target version of the Wazuh agent to install.
# -InstallVer			      The version of the Wazuh Agent to install.
# -DefaultInstallVer 	  Command line paramenter and a preset within the script that is used as a last resort.
# -DownloadSource     	Static download path to fetch Wazuh agent installer.  Overrides WazuhVer value.
# -SkipOsquery  		    Flag to not signal the Wazuh manager to push managed Osquery WPK to this system. (Default is to not skip this.)
# -Install      		    Flag to skip all checks and force installation
# -Uninstall    		    Flag to uninstall Wazuh agent only 
# -CheckOnly    		    Flag to only run checks to see if installation is current or in need of deployment
# -LBprobe      		    Flag to additionally check for manager connectivity with an agent-auth probe to avoid being fooled by a load balancer that 
# 						          handshakes even when service down.
# -Debug        		    Flag to show debug output
# -help					        Show command line options

# Sample way to fetch and use this script:
#
# curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/branchnetconsulting/wazuh-tools/master/siem-agent-deploy.sh > siem-agent-deploy.sh
# chmod 700 siem-agent-deploy.sh
#

#
# Sample command line:
#
# ./siem-agent-deploy.sh -Mgr "siem.wycliffe.org" -Mgr "{Manager DNS or IP}" -RegPass "{Your_Password}" -ExtraGroups "{Your_comma_separated_group_list}" -Debug
#

#
# Please note that the following groups are built into the script and should be added to the Wazuh Manager PRIOR to any use of this script.
#
# "linux,linux-local,osquery,osquery-local".

# merge-wazuh-conf:
# version 1.0
# by Kevin Branch (Branch Network Consulting, LLC)
#
# This builds and applies a fresh /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf from a merge of all /var/ossec/etc/conf.d/*.conf files, with automatic revertion to the previous ossec.conf in the event that Wazuh Agent fails to restart or reconnect with the newer merged version of ossec.conf.
# It is intended to be run automatically by Wazuh Agent itself via a locally defined command-type localfile section invoking it at ossec-agent scripts/merge-wazuh-conf:.
# This is part of accomodating the use of custom WPKs to securely distribute and/or invoke new scripts and to distribute and apply new config sections to be merged into ossec.conf, especially ones involving formerly "remote" commands.
